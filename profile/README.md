# [Pylon.sh](https://pylon.sh)

Firstly lets go over what Pylon is! Pylon is (will be) a messaging app that 
kinda resembles your fav app, Telegram, but with its own set of features. With 
of course the same basic security and privacy that telegram offers. This README
and all subsequent documents will go over how Pylon will operate and be written
in the future. 

I won't go deep into specifics here, that may get a little lengthy, so I'll split
it up into pages:

- [Api](pages/Api.md)  
The Api page will go over how the API will be structured. 
- [Database](pages/Database.md)  
The Database page will go over how the database should be structured. This one
is a little special as it may change constnatly... so like don't take what it
says as a final strucutre for the database.  

And lastly, the [Features](pages/Features.md) page. This page will go over the 
features of Pylon. Like the database page, don't take what the stuff said in this
page as a final word on the features.

Anyways, if you have anything to say head over to the [discussion](https://github.com/pylon-sh/.github/discussions/2)
for the planning phase.
