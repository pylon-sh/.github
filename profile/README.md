# Pylon.sh

Pylon.sh is a privacy oriented messaging app built like your favourite apps. This
readme, and the following linked documents will go over how Pylon.sh will eventually
work and define how stuff will be handled. You can check out our website [here](https://pylon.sh).s

We'll start off by talking about why Pylon.sh was made. To be frank there is no
real reason other than I wanted a project that would be long term. So hopefully this
doesn't fail or I get bored super quickly. It was also created as a learning project
for me, I hope this will help me get better at writing APIs and making sure data is secure.

Now, what do I mean by "built like your favourite apps"? Like [Telegram](https://telegram.org),
[Pylon.sh](https://pylon.sh) is security and privacy based. Your data will be heavily
encrypted and you won't have to worry about peeping eyes. We hope to list some features
soon but before that the dirty parts have to get tackled first (e.g. Database layouts, API layout, etc.).

But with that a few features will definitely be added, here is a list:
- "Burnable" messages. Basically messages that automatically expire
- Private dms. Messages won't be saved anywhere in private dms  

(There isn't much, but what is here might remind you of a certain app ðŸ‘€).
You can find a full list of features with their descriptions [here](pages/Features.md).
